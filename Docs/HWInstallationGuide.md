# Bottomcase install

## Step 1

Firstly be sure to check if all the required parts are found like in the image below. You should have 2 tiny screws for the ESP32, the 3D print to hold the parts, the lithium battery holder+battery management system+ESP32, another set of screws for the bms and finally the 4 big ones to screw in the lid to the enclosure.

## Step 2

Now that you have confirmed that all components are included be sure to safely insert the battery holder inside of the 3D printed screwholder since it will be easier to mount it inside of the enclose this way.

## Step 3

After that is done the screwholder can be safely slotted in making sure that the curved side is aimed to the top and that it looks like the image below. Then you can use the 4 tiny included screws to screw in the esp and the BMS system into the enclosure.

## Step 4

Next the battery can be slotted into the enclosure making sure that the polarity is correct. This can be checked by aligning the + and minus sign as shown in the image below.

# Final note

Inside the resources folder multiple sets of files can be found. An [OBJ](/3D%20models/ScrewholderOBJ.obj), [STL](/3D%20models/ScrewholderSTL.stl), and a [3MF](/3D%20models/Screwholder.3mf). As a team the recommended one for printing is the 3MF it is currently set up to print properly for the Bambulab X1C. This will simply need to be delivered
to someone who owns any printer (does not need to be a Bambulab) and then
printed with ease.
